{ Let's start our explorations in chronological order - by examining a brilliant casual game Steinitz played in Vienna back in 1960. I couldn't find much information about the occasion or about Steinitz's opponent - but the game itself features a very pretty combination that is very good evidence of Steinitz's manner of play at the time.
After the opening struggle in the King's Gambit, Steinitz - having sacrificed a knight and the bishop earlier, has brought out the enemy king in the open and obtained a winning position. On move 11, he continues the onslaught by adding more fuel to the fire. }
11. Rxf8 { A very nice move, eliminating the defender of the knight on h6 and also weakening Black's dark-squares. It seems as if White doesn't have enough pieces to continue the attack, but Black's king's position is a permanent issue. This is not the only winning move in the position - but it is a fully correct and effective one. } 11... Qxf8 (11... Rxf8 12. Bg5+ { Is also losing-. } 12... Rf6 13. e5 { And White will regain some material with the king still being in the open. }) 12. Bg5+ Ke6?! { This might not be the most resistant, but we really shouldn't criticize the defensive capabilities of players from 1860 too harshly. } (12... Kd6 { Apparently, it is better to go with the king to d6 immediately without provoking d5 as in this case the square on c6 is free for the king. } 13. Na3 Ne5 { The only move not to lose on the spot. Now White has to find the very tough } 14. Nc4+ { Diverting the knight from e5 and preventing the check on f3. } (14. Nb5+ { Now doesn't lead anywhere due to } 14... Kc6 { This is the reason why it is better not to provoke White from playing d5 - c6 is available to the king and actually Black is the one who is winning now. }) (14. dxe5+ Kc6 { Again the king escapes via the c6 square! })) 13. d5+ Kd6 { I think Black wanted to free the e5 square for the knight, but it turns out that the pawn on d5 has a useful role on d5. } 14. Nd2?! { Also not the best move as the knight is needed on b5. } (14. Na3 { Is much stronger, as now both Nb5 and Nc4 are threatened and the first rank is covered. It is not easy to see that after } { [%cal Ga3b5,Ga3c4] } 14... Ne5 15. Nb5+ Kc5 16.

Ne5 { Would have justified Black's decision to provoke d5 and free the e5 square for the knight. White doesn't have anything better than } 15. Bxh6 { Regaining one piece and keeping the initiative due to the Black's exposed king. But at least Black doesn't get mated immediately. }) 15. Be3+ Kb5 (15...

Perhaps not the cleanest combination, but an entertaining and beautiful one nevertheless, very much demonstrating that Steinitz had the proficiency to play in the romantic style in his youth. } 1-0

{ The following game was played in the historic London tournament in 1862 - one of the strongest chess tournaments of that era. Even though Steinitz didn't win a prize and ended up in fifth place, he distinguished himself by playing a few notable games, featuring some stunning combinations, announcing to the chess world that a new talent has appeared on the horizon.
His game against Austrian master Augustus Mongredien was one of those notable games. After a very aggressive opening, Steinitz has obtained a promising attacking position. We join the game on move 16. Can you find the winning shot Steinitz executed in the game? }
16. Rxh7 { Boom! With this stunning rook sacrifice, Steinitz destroys the opponent's king position. The sacrifice is fully correct - mainly due to the pawn weaknesses around the black king and due to the fact that a number of Black's pieces is stuck on the queenside, unable to come to the aid of their monarch (while the same can't be said of White's pieces). Note that the prosaic capture on g4 was sufficient to win, but Steinitz's choice is much more memorable and stylish. } { [%csl Rg4,Rg6] } 16...

{ In the later part of the 1860s (and 1870s), Steinitz distinguished himself as the best player in the world. However, since the chess tournaments were not organized as regularly back in the day as they are today, in order to demonstrate dominance you had to beat your contemporaries in matches. In the 1860s and 1870s, therefore, Steinitz played a series of matches with leading (and less leading) players of the time, including the one against Henry Bird - the inventor and the biggest proponent of the 1.f4 Bird opening - in 1866.
Steinitz won that match quite convincingly - but game 6 of the match featured a particularly nice combination. In the diagram position, Black has a forced mate in 8 moves. Can you find it? }
13... Rde8+! { A beautiful, although not TERRIBLY difficult, concept. Even though he is a piece down, Black doesn't hesitate to also sacrifice the exchange, in order to bring in more pieces into the attack. } (13... Rhe8+ { Is equally good as it basically comes to the same. }) 14. Bxe8 Rxe8+ 15. Kf2 Qe3+ 16. Kf1 Bxf3! { This is the point of the combination. Due to the weakness of the back rank, White can't recapture with the queen and thus has to compromise the king's shelter even further. } 17. gxf3 Bc5 { These kinds of "quiet" (as in - non-forcing) moves are often ones that are very hard to visualize in the advance. This move creates a brutal threat of mate in 1 and it is not surprising White can't do anything about it with all the pieces on the back rank - despite the extra rook! } { [%csl Gf2][%cal Rc5f2] } 18. Kg2 Rg8+ { And due to the mate on the next move after either Kf1 or Kh3, Bird resigned here. A very nice tactical combination! } 0-1

{ Even though Steinitz definitely had a big combinational talent, as we have just seen, in the history of chess he is primarily remembered as an original thinker, who laid down the foundations of the modern chess theory and positional play (although in very primitive and rudimentary form).
His creativity and original approach to chess can be seen in many shapes and forms when studying his games. But probably the most vivid illustration of his unconventional, out-of-the-box thinking is the following crazy opening variation in the Vienna variation which he unleashed against the American Louis Paulsen in the tournament in Baden Baden in 1870.
In this theoretical position, Qh4 is threatened, and almost everyone prevented it by developing the knight to f3. However, Steinitz came with an ingenious and creative idea, completely ignoring Black's concept. }
4. d4! { A stunning and outrageous idea. Steinitz decides to occupy the center at all costs, completely ignoring the idea of Qh4. You might be wondering - hang on, but what happens if Black decides to give a check nevertheless? } 4... Qh4+ 5. Ke2!! { Simply stunning, outrageous idea that was well-ahead of its time. At that time, everyone was playing for swift attacks and the initiative, so king safety was considered to be of paramount importance. Yet, here Steinitz decides to completely violate all opening principles and fundaments of opening theory by moving the king in front of the pieces, losing the castling rights in the process. However, the idea is very modern - that Black will be unable to immediately exploit this positioning of the king since White has good control of the center. White is also trying to make an argument that his next moves will come with the gain of tempo on the queen and that he will be eventually able to consolidate the position and utilize the center to obtain an advantage.
Even though this idea turned out to be not fully correct, even nowadays very strong players occasionally venture to play this risky variation, which is nowadays known as Steinitz's Gambit. However, very similar idea of violating the opening principles and moving the king very early in the opening is nowadays seen in a number of openings (google: Four Knights Sicilian Ke2 for more info). Thus, as with many Steinitz's ideas - even though the concrete execution was not 100% correct, the core fundamental idea behind it was definitely sound. } 1-0

{ As mentioned earlier, in this study you will not only see brilliant combinations but also some very creative/revolutionary ideas that were very much ahead of the time. In the previous example, we have seen a very original idea in the opening, while in the current example, I would like to demonstrate a middlegame technique from a game against American master Alexander Sellman, played in 1885 (after Steinitz's 9-year hiatus from 1773-1882, but before his 1886 match against Zukertort). I have selected this example because Steinitz's implemented a middlegame technique/principle that is nowadays pretty standard, but that was quite novel and ahead of the time in the 19th century.
So, we have a position from the French defence where the pawn structure is quite locked and where White is clearly better due to the dark-square control, the powerful knight on d4, and the bad bishop on b7. However, due to the closed nature of the position and the absence of any clear weaknesses/targets in the Black camp, White doesn't have anything very direct at their disposal at the moment, so it is time to improve the position. In this position, Steinitz embarked on the technique of improving the worst-placed piece.
Can you detect which piece it is and how did Steinitz go about improving it? }
20. Nb1 { A very instructive positional maneuver. The knight was not doing much on c3, so it gets rerouted to greener pastures on a5/c5 via the b1-d2-b3 route. This slow maneuvering is possible because the position is fairly closed and static in its nature, so White has all the time in the world to improve the placement of the pieces.
This principle of "improving the worst placed piece" can nowadays be found in many books. But back in the day, I am not 100% sure how standard it was to make this "ugly" move and move the knight back. This reveals Steinitz's deep thinking and understanding of the game. --- It has to be mentioned that this is also among the first two choices of the engine! } { [%csl Ba5,Bc5][%cal Gb1d2,Gd2b3,Gb3a5] } 20... g6 { Unfortunately for Black, due to the passivity of the position and the lack of space, he doesn't have equally useful maneuver and can't really do anything to meet White's maneuvering plan. } 21. Nd2 Nd7 22. N2b3 { [%csl Ga5,Gc5][%cal Gb3a5] } 22... Rc8 23. Na5 { Mission accomplished. The knight is now very annoying on a5 compared to c3 and is disturbing the bishop on b7. In just 3 moves, White has improved the situation tremendously and Steinitz went on to win this game convincingly. } { [%cal Ra5b7] } 1-0

{ Continuing our journey through the 1880s - the following position was taken from the very first game of the historic 1886 match between Steinitz and Zukertort. This match was historic as it was the first-ever official match for the title of the World Chess Champion and marks the beginning of the lineage of the classical world champions that lasts to this day. (if you are not familiar with the match background, I can only suggest you watch the following video I made on the topic: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zIHjMVukgAU)
This was, therefore, the first ever game played in an official World Chess Championship match. Zukertort, having the White pieces, played a very bad opening and Steinitz quickly obtained a promising position with attacking chances on the kingside due to the space advantage secured by the pawn on e4. With his last move, Nh4, he forced Zukertort to move the g-pawn forward and chase the knight away. But does the knight really have to go back? Can you find the sequence of moves that Steinitz played that yielded him the decisive advantage? }

Furthermore, it is very important that White has a lack of space in the center and on the kingside, meaning that the pieces on the queenside can't easily join the defense. } { [%csl Ra1,Rb2,Rc3,Rd2,Rf1] } 0-1

{ Let's take a look at another example from the 1886 World Chess Championship match. Even though the battle in the match was extremely hard-fought - by winning games 11, 12 and 13, Steinitz grabbed a decisive lead he never relinquished until the end of the match - especially since Zukertort got tired (or tilted?) and started playing worse and worse as the match was nearing its end.
Nevertheless, the subsequent struggle featured some very nice and convincing games - and I have personally always been very fond of game number 19. Steinitz, again with the Black pieces, completely outplayed the opponent and obtained a winning position. There are many good moves in the diagram position - but Steinitz chose a very stylish - and also the strongest one. Can you find the move he played? }

{ As mentioned earlier, in his youth, Steinitz was very well known for his combinational, romantic style. And even though he devised a completely new approach to the game later in his life, laying the foundations for the modern school of chess (in a very primitive, rudimentary, form), he never really lost his youthful fervor and inclination toward tactical, aggressive play.
It is noteworthy that some of his most famous, brilliant combinations actually happened in the very late stages of his life - and to conclude this study/pgn/video, we will take a look at three very noteworthy ones.
Let's start with Steinitz's famous combination executed in the 4th game of his World Chess Championship match against Russian master Mikhail Chigorin in 1892.
We join the action on move 23. We can see that we have a very sharp position with the kings on opposite sides of the board. However, it turns out that Black's king is much more unsafe - not only because there are less pawns in front of it - but also because Black was forced to give up the dark-squared bishop on the previous move - an important defender of the dark-squares around the king.
Of course, White's next move will involve the recapture of the bishop. But there are two ways of doing so. Can you decide whether it is better to capture with the rook or the bishop - and provide some sample lines that demonstrate why one choice is better than the other? }
23. Rxd4! { The best reply and the beginning of one of the most famous chess combinations of all time. White recaptures the bishop with the rook in order to keep the dark-squared bishop, which will play a decisive role in the upcoming attack, as we will soon see. } (23. Bxd4+ { Recapturing with the bishop is much inferior as after } 23... Nxd4 24. Rxh7+ { Sacrifice doesn't work as there is no dark-squared bishop. } (24. Rxd4 { Should be played instead, when White has only a small avantage. })) 23... Nxd4 24. Rxh7+!! { The point of the combination! White doesn't recapture the knight, but sacrifices a rook to ruin the king's shelter. Even though White only has two bishops and the queen, the attack is deadly! } 24... Kxh7 25. Qh1+ { [%cal Rh1h7] } 25... Kg7 26. Bh6+ { [%cal Rh6f8,Rb3g8] } 26... Kf6 27. Qh4+ { An important check, preventing the king from escaping via e7.

{ Last but not least, let's take a look at the combination from one of the last competitions of Steinitz's career - the 1895/1896 tournament in St. Petersburg. After Steinitz lost his title to Lasker in 1894 and Harry Nelson Pillsbury won the Hastings tournament in 1895, it was not 100% clear who the strongest player in the world might be. The tournament in St. Petersburg was organized to settle this dispute and the 5 strongest players of the world were invited: Lasker, Steinitz, Chigorin, Pilsbury and Tarrasch (the latter declining due to work obligations).
And even though the tournament initially turned out into the race between Lasker and Pillsbury, after their 3rd round encounter (the tournament was a 6-way round robin), Pillsbury started stumbling and ultimately ended up in the third place, allowing Steinitz to overtake him and win the second place behind Lasker!
And even though Steinitz lost his mini-match to Lasker with -3+1=2, he did beat him in one encounter in a very brilliant fashion. Thus, the entire tournament can be regarded as Steinitz's swan song.
Moreover, the victory against Lasker was achieved in quite a brilliant manner. We join the game on move 14 and we can see that the position is already a big mess. Lasker, in his typical style, pushed the pawn on f4 on his last move. How should White react here? }
14. Qxe4 { Brilliant! Steinitz sacrifices the bishop on g3 in order to eliminate a few pawns and weaken the opponent's king. This is not only fully correct, but it is also necessary, as this is the only clear way for White to obtain a serious advantage. } { [%csl Rf4,Gh7][%cal Ge4h7] } (14. Bxf4 { For example, capturing on f4 with the bishop would run into } 14... e5 { With very unclear consequences. It was precisely something like this that Lasker was hoping for, so Steinitz's reply must have come as a cold shower! }) 14... fxg3 15. hxg3 { Threatening mate in 1. } { [%cal Rh1h7,Re4h7] } 15... g6 { Trying to either blunt the b1-h7 diagonal or invite White to take the pawn on g6 and lose some time by moving his queen back and forth! } (15... g5 { Doesn't lose a pawn, but allows } 16. Ne2 { When White has various attacking options - Bd3, Rh6, Rhh1, etc. The position is objectively won! }) 16. Qxg6 { Nevertheless, Steinitz takes on g6, exploiting the pin along the h-file. Now, White has three pawns for the piece and an ongoing initiative as the Black king is very weak. Steinitz went on to convert his advantage, win the game and win an important point that surely propelled him toward the 2nd place! } 1-0
